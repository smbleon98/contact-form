Module 11 React Form - Code Exploration

OPTIONAL FEATURES - 
I added a field for Phone number by recycling part of the code we were given.
I did not make any stylistic adjustments.

ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS - 
I noticed that the validations are not real-time as I assumed the definition being; you have to click "Submit" in order to see the error messages about which required fields are missing values. I had expected real-time to mean that you would get feedback as you click out of the field. However, as I write that, I can consider how it would be an annoying user experience to get red errors on all upcoming fields already knowing that you're going to fill them out in order to submit the form to begin with.
